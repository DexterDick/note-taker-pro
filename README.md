# Note Taker Pro

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create an application to write, save and delete notes using node and express fs module. The applicationâ€™s front end was provided. my job as a full stack developer was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku. The following HTML routes was created:

-   GET `/notes` - returns the `notes.html` file.
-   GET `*` - return the `index.html` file.

The following API routes were created:

-   GET `/api/notes` - reads `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

-   POST `/api/notes` - receives a new note to save on the request body, adding it to the `db.json` file, and returns the new note to the client.
-   DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - receives a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete from the `db.json` file.
